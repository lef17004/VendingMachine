#  Objective-C Class Test

## Overview
This program builds on the Inventory class I made to learn Objective-C. I created a basic vending machine using inheritance. 

## Development Envirnment
I created this using Xcode version 12.1. To set up this project, first install Xcode if you don't have it already. Then go to Source Control->Clone and then paste in the link to this Github repository. The project should download and be setup automatically.
